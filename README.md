## Description

_"Progress should mean growing competence in self-care rather than growing dependence." -Dr. Ivan Illich, Tools for Conviviality_

_The PDX Farm Share Android application is a social media application that connects users to a platform for sharing and bartering food and other usable plants in Portland.  The app relies on the native features of Android and it's integration with other Google products, such as Maps and Firebase.  Users can create accounts, add items to the inventory, search others' items (via list or map), and view a data layer of the Portland edible tree map.  Additionally, users can contact each other to gather together, arrange pick-ups and drop-offs, and as well as, negotiate barters._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _You will need to have the [Java SDK (Standard Edition Development Kit)](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) & [Java SDK (Standard Edition Development Kit)](https://www.java.com/en/) installed on your computer_
* _Next you will need to Install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html)_
* _Clone this repository and open with Android Studio_
* _It should automatically build Gradle on opening and again when you click the play button or select run in one of many locations_
* _Next you will need to choose your emulator or hook up your android phone in developer mode. I used Nexus 6 and Nexus 5X emulators (be aware that this will dramatically slow your computer <unless you are operating with 16 GB RAM or more>)_
* _Once the app loads, you should be able to navigate freely_

_There are quite a few gaps in the functionality that will follow data persistence._

## Known Bugs

_Without all the firebase date persistence in place, a lot of the app does nothing.  Additionally, I am struggling with my Google Map Fragment._
